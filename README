* router-tools overview

router-tools is a collection of scripts and hacks which folks might find
useful. i'll add to / edit these as appropriate.  some of these line up
nicely with the router tools from the ISC folks. 

mktopo.pl - this will take a passel of cisco router configurations and 
generate a graphviz dot file (or a PNG if you're in an hurry) that will show
you which interfaces are associated with other interfaces and how things
connect to each other.  some disambiguation of SVIs is integrated in this.
