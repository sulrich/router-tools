mktopo.pl 

the intent here is to take a directory full of cisco router configuration
files and generate the appropriate DOT file output.

at some point the router tools from ISC broke for me and i figured i should
probably hack away at this myself to get what i wanted.  

if you have folks dump a crapload of configurations in your lap and ask you to
make heads or tails of things, this might be very useful to you.
